# shunt-the-yard

An implementation of the [shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) for parsing [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) notation and turning it into [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
The intent is to make it easier to evaluate mathematical expressions where some parts take precedence, either by the nature of operator precedence, or via expressions nested in parentheses.
